# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**AI_잡돌이** is a Korean-language content creation project focused on AI monetization strategies and YouTube content production. The primary output is educational content teaching Korean audiences how to leverage AI for income generation.

### Core Purpose
- Create psychology-driven YouTube narration scripts optimized for Korean audiences
- Develop frameworks for AI-powered content monetization
- Target Korean viewers interested in "집에서 쉽게" (easy home-based) income opportunities

## Repository Structure

### Key Files

**`youtube_narration_framework.md`** - Master template for Korean YouTube video scripts
- 7-section psychological framework (HOOK → PROBLEM → AGITATE → SOLUTION → VALUE → PROOF → CTA)
- Korean audience psychology optimization (무료→유료 funnel, efficiency obsession, FOMO triggers)
- 10-minute video structure with retention hooks at 3min, 5min, 7min marks
- Includes complete worked example: "AI로 월 300만원 버는 법"

**`아무도 알려주지 않은 AI 수익화`** - Sample narration copy
- Introductory script for AI monetization content
- Target audience: Korean speakers wanting to learn AI or generate AI-based income

## Content Creation Workflow

### Creating New YouTube Scripts

1. **Define Variables** - Use the worksheet in `youtube_narration_framework.md`:
   - Target audience (직장인/주부/학생/프리랜서)
   - Result promise (월 OO만원/시간 절약)
   - Timeframe (3일/2주/1달)
   - Method name (specific system/process)

2. **Apply 7-Section Structure**:
   - HOOK (0-15s): Strong number/result to grab attention
   - PROBLEM (15-45s): 3 pain points for empathy
   - AGITATE (45s-1:30): Explain why they haven't succeeded yet
   - SOLUTION INTRO (1:30-2:00): Tease the solution
   - VALUE DELIVERY (2:00-8:00): 3-5 step process with examples
   - SOCIAL PROOF (8:00-9:00): 3 case studies with diverse profiles
   - CTA (9:00-10:00): 3-tier funnel (무료 → 무료+ → 유료)

3. **Insert Psychological Triggers** - Minimum 2 per section:
   - 호기심갭 (curiosity gap)
   - 손실회피 (loss aversion)
   - 사회적증거 (social proof)
   - FOMO (fear of missing out)
   - 즉각보상 (instant gratification)

4. **Optimize First 30 Seconds** (Algorithm Survival Zone):
   - **0-5초**: Provocative question OR relatable statement (NO greetings!)
   - **5-15초**: Immediate value proposition (NO subscription requests!)
   - **15-25초**: Clear content roadmap
   - **25-30초**: Emotional hook (suspense/empathy/curiosity)

5. **Add Retention Hooks** at critical dropout points:
   - 3:00 mark: "⚠️ 잠깐! 다음 단계 놓치면..."
   - 5:00 mark: "여기서 80%가 실수하는 부분"
   - 7:00 mark: "마지막 핵심, 집중하세요"

### Creating Series Narration (Multi-Episode Content)

**CRITICAL: When developing narration scripts based on previous episodes in `contents/` folder:**

#### Story Continuity Framework

**Always connect episodes naturally:**
```
Episode N (previous) → Episode N+1 (current)
- Reference what was learned/built previously
- Show natural progression and discovery
- Create "aha moments" from previous experience
```

**Example Flow:**
```
Episode 2: Made business manual (CLAUDE.md)
↓
Episode 3: Used it → Discovered patterns → Want to save patterns
         (Natural progression from experience)
```

#### Balance: Progress (진도) + Practice (연습)

Every episode must balance TWO dimensions:

**1. Technical Progress (기술/진도)**
- New tools/features to learn (e.g., custom commands, agents, MCP)
- Concrete skills that advance capabilities
- "What you need to know to proceed"

**2. Business Practice (비즈니스/연습)**
- Core competencies independent of tools (e.g., logical thinking, pattern recognition)
- Fundamental skills that transfer across contexts
- "What you need to practice to succeed"

**Integration Pattern:**
```
❌ BAD: "Today we learn custom commands" (tech only)
❌ BAD: "Today we practice logical thinking" (practice only)

✅ GOOD: "Custom commands (진도) + Cycle creation practice (연습)"
         "Tool = Commands, Practice = Using the tool to build logical thinking"
```

#### Natural Motivation Architecture

**Three-layered motivation in every episode:**

**1. Information (정보)**
- "Here's what's possible" (tools, features, concepts)
- Clear, concrete knowledge
- Example: "Custom commands let you save workflows"

**2. Practice (연습)**
- "Here's how to develop the skill" (exercises, frameworks)
- Actionable training
- Example: "Break your work into logical cycles"

**3. Motivation (동기부여)**
- "Here's why it matters for YOU" (results, outcomes, freedom)
- Personal relevance and emotional connection
- Example: "Your discovered patterns → automated income"

**Delivery Method:**
```
Start: Motivation ("You can automate what you already do")
Middle: Information + Practice interleaved ("Commands = tool, Cycles = practice")
End: Motivation ("This leads to 4편's full automation")
```

#### Episode Connection Template

When referencing previous episodes:

```markdown
**From Episode [N]:**
- What was learned: [core concept]
- What was built: [artifact/skill]

**Natural Discovery:**
- "When I used [N], I noticed [pattern]"
- "This works, but [limitation/pain point]"

**Episode [N+1] Solution:**
- Technical progress: [new tool/feature]
- Practice component: [skill to develop]
- Why both matter: [motivation/outcome]

**Preview Episode [N+2]:**
- Where this leads naturally
- Next level of capability
```

#### Prohibited Patterns

**❌ Don't:**
- Teach tools without showing practice application
- Teach practice without concrete tool implementation
- Ignore previous episode learnings
- Jump to new topics without natural bridge
- Present "정답" (correct answers) - always present as "your way"

**✅ Do:**
- Show experience → discovery → need → solution
- Balance 기술 (tech progress) and 비즈니스 (core practice)
- Connect each episode to previous work
- Frame tools as enablers of practice
- Emphasize personalization ("나만의 방식")

### Korean Audience Psychology Patterns

**Critical Cultural Insights**:
1. **"집에서 쉽게, 돈 안들고"** - Low barrier entry is essential
   - Always start with free/low-cost approach
   - Emphasize "at home" and "easy" messaging

2. **Efficiency Obsession** - Time-saving is premium value
   - Korean audiences will pay to save time after seeing value
   - Frame paid offerings as "시간 절약" not just content access

3. **Free-to-Premium Funnel** - Standard conversion path:
   - Level 1: Free content (video save, subscribe)
   - Level 2: Free resources (PDF checklist, community)
   - Level 3: Paid shortcut (course, consulting, templates)

## Content Guidelines

### Korean Language Style
- Use casual but authoritative tone (반말 in examples, but 존댓말 to viewer)
- Include specific numbers and results (월 300만원, 하루 2시간)
- Emphasize social proof with Korean name format (김OO, 박OO)

### Prohibited Elements (Causes Viewer Dropout)
- ❌ **First 30 seconds mistakes** (algorithm rejection triggers):
  - Greetings/introductions (0-5초)
  - Subscription requests (0-15초)
  - Repetitive intros without value
- ❌ Long self-introductions before delivering value
- ❌ Abstract concepts without concrete numbers/examples
- ❌ Valueless intros (get to the point immediately)
- ❌ Missing or unclear CTA
- ❌ Inconsistent energy/tone throughout

### Success Metrics

**CTR (Click-Through Rate) - Survival Indicator**:
- **8%+**: Viral potential (algorithm actively promotes)
- **5-7%**: Stable growth (normal distribution)
- **<3%**: Risk zone (algorithm may suppress)
- **Goal**: Thumbnail + Title must trigger **emotional response**, not just convey information

**Retention Benchmarks**:
- **First 30 seconds**: 70%+ retention (algorithm judgment zone)
- **3-minute mark**: 50%+ retention
- **Completion Rate**: 30%+ viewers reach CTA section

**Channel Growth Milestones**:
- **Minimum 5 videos** before expecting algorithm support
- YouTube evaluates channel consistency across multiple videos, not individual performance
- Maintain consistent messaging, tone, and subject matter across all videos

### Video Performance Analysis

**Failed Videos = Learning Data**

Every underperforming video provides diagnostic insights. Use YouTube Studio to analyze:

**1. Drop-off Point Analysis**
- Identify exact timestamps where viewers leave
- Diagnose the problem:
  - Too boring/slow?
  - Expectation mismatch?
  - Too complex/technical?

**2. Engagement Zone Analysis**
- Find sections where viewers stay engaged
- What worked? (analogies, examples, mindset shifts?)
- Replicate successful patterns

**3. Emotional Resonance Analysis**
- Check comments and likes per section
- Which messages created emotional connection?

**Improvement Cycle**:
```
Analyze failed video (Studio)
↓
Identify 3 drop-off points
↓
Form hypothesis (why did they leave?)
↓
Apply fixes in next video
↓
A/B test (before vs. after)
```

**Key Mindset**: Underperforming videos are NOT wasted effort—they're your most valuable learning material. After 5 videos, clear patterns will emerge.

## File Naming Conventions

- Use Korean for content files: `[주제]` or `[영상제목]`
- Use descriptive English for framework files: `youtube_narration_framework.md`
- Keep files in project root (no complex directory structure yet)
